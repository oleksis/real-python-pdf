# Real Python PDF
![Tests](https://github.com/oleksis/real-python-pdf/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

# Motivation
Real Python is an excellent site to learn Python, it has a large number of articles, 
from a basic to advanced level on different topics. During a certain time you can 
collect the list of articles of your interest and organize/structure them in a 
__Table of Contents__ (TOC) and then create a PDF (Python CookBook üë®üèæ‚Äçüç≥üßæüìñüêç) and 
access its Off-Line reading.

# Requirements
* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
* [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/)

# Usage
You can create a __Table of Contents__ (TOC) by following the Links syntax in 
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

When run `main.py` it reads the __TOC__ block from this `README.md`, it creates the 
list of links to download the __PDF__ version of each article and save it in the `pdfs` 
folder. When finished, merge all the pdfs passing the __Outlines/Bookmarks__ and save 
the final pdf as `Real_Python.pdf` in the root directory.

```bash
python main.py
```
